My solutions to selected exercises in chapter 7 of Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++ Fourth Edition by Mark A. Weiss, updated with extra comments. These were completed in June 2023 as a part of my data structures course.
These solutions are provided as a proof of course work ONLY, do NOT use this code in any shape or form to complete ANY university coursework. Portions of the code were adapted/copied from the text of the book and are (C) Mark Weiss.
